<h1>Hello</h1>
<div>A spectral color is a color that is evoked in a typical human by a single wavelength of light in the visible spectrum, or by a relatively narrow band of wavelengths, also known as monochromatic light. Every wavelength of visible light is perceived as a spectral color, in a continuous spectrum; the colors of sufficiently close wavelengths are indistinguishable for the human eye.</div>
<div>
The spectrum is often divided into named colors, though any division is somewhat arbitrary; the spectrum is continuous. Traditional colors in English include: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan (sky-blue), blue ("true" blue), and violet. In some other languages the ranges corresponding to color names do not necessarily agree with those in English.</div>

<h1>Walt Disney</h1>

<div id="grad1">
<p> Walter Elias Disney ( December 5, 1901 â€“ December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, writer, voice actor, and
film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film 
producer, he holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with 
two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film 
Registry by the Library of Congress.</p></div><br>

<p> Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a 
commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. 
With Ub Iwerks, he developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation 
in the early years.</p></div><br>

<div id="grad3">
<p> As the studio grew, he became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length 
cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio, 
Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed 
after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy 
Awards.</p></div><br>

<div id="grad4">
<p> In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the amusement park industry, and in July 1955 he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. To fund the 
project he diversified into television programs, such as Walt Disney's Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club. He was also involved in planning 
the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World's Fair.</p><br>

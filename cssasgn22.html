<p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages bound together and protected by a cover.</p>

<p>a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained.</p>
